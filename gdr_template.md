## Context

(where does the policy applies to)

## Decision

(The policy content, including code/data/metadata snippets if necessary)

### Lifecycle

## Where the policy becomes computational

- **LOCAL POLICY**: (when the policy is applied as part of the local scope of a data asset, or data product, e.g. live execution context of an orchestrated set of pipelines)
- **GLOBAL POLICY**: (when the policy is applied to all the assets, e.g. to all the data products using a specific output port)

- policy code: (link to the policy-as-code related file, if any)
