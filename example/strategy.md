# ACME Strategy

In ACME, as of industrial plan 2023-2025, we have decided to adopt the Data Mesh paradigm as data strategy.

## Document purpose

The purpose of this document is to collect the high-level status quo, according to all the specific decisions that are formalized as **GDR**. The related GDR ids shall be reported when describing a specific top level vision.

## Content Summary

The strategy for ACME data mesh implementation is divided into 4 sections, according the 4 pillars of the paradigm:

1. Decentralized Domain Ownership
2. Data As A Product
3. Self-serve infrastructure as a Platform
4. Federated Computational Governance

### Decentralized Domain Ownership

TBD

### Data As A Product

ACME considers an acceptable "Data Product" an asset with <this> <this> <and that>.

When it comes to Output Ports, the following types are currently supported:
- files: these must be created according to the specifications in [GDR-0001](./data-mesh/data-product/output-port/files/0001-data-product-output-port-files.md).
- SQL: these must be created according to the specifications in TBD
- events: these must be created according to the specifications in TBD

### Self-serve infrastructure as a Platform

TBD

### Federated Computational Governance

TBD

## Operating model

The operating model to come to the decisions formalized as GDR is ... 

## More

TBD
